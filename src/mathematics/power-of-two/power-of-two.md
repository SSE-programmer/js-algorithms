**Problem** - Give a positive integer 'n', determine if the number is a power of 2 or not.

An integer is a power of two if there exists an integer 'x' such that 'n' === 2<sup>x</sup>

Algorithms:
- [power-of-two.js](./power-of-two.js) - O(log(n))
- [power-of-two-optimized.js](./power-of-two-optimized.js) - O(1)
